## Code Style

We follow strict code style guidelines:

### Python Style

- **PEP 8** compliance
- **Type hints** for all public functions
- **NumPy docstrings** format
- **Maximum line length**: 88 characters (Black default)

### Formatting Tools

```bash
# Auto-format with Black
black src/prismo/

# Check with ruff
ruff check src/prismo/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy src/prismo/

# All checks
make lint
```

### Example

```python
def compute_overlap(
    Ex: np.ndarray,
    Ey: np.ndarray,
    mode: WaveguideMode,
    dx: float,
    dy: float,
) -> complex:
    """
    Compute mode overlap integral.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Ex, Ey : ndarray
        Electric field components.
    mode : WaveguideMode
        Waveguide mode for overlap.
    dx, dy : float
        Grid spacing.

    Returns
    -------
    complex
        Overlap coefficient.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> overlap = compute_overlap(Ex, Ey, mode, 1e-8, 1e-8)
    >>> assert abs(overlap) <= 1.0
    """
    # Implementation with type hints and clear logic
    overlap = 0.5 * np.sum((Ex * np.conj(mode.Ey) - Ey * np.conj(mode.Ex))) * dx * dy
    return complex(overlap)
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_modes.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=prismo --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Tests

Every new feature must include tests:

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
from prismo.modes.solver import ModeSolver

class TestModeSolver:
    """Test mode solver functionality."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def simple_waveguide(self):
        """Create a simple test waveguide."""
        x = np.linspace(-2e-6, 2e-6, 50)
        y = np.linspace(-2e-6, 2e-6, 50)
        epsilon = np.ones((50, 50)) * 1.5**2
        return x, y, epsilon

    def test_mode_solver_creation(self, simple_waveguide):
        """Test that ModeSolver can be created."""
        x, y, eps = simple_waveguide
        solver = ModeSolver(1.55e-6, x, y, eps)
        assert solver is not None

    def test_fundamental_mode(self, simple_waveguide):
        """Test solving for fundamental mode."""
        x, y, eps = simple_waveguide
        solver = ModeSolver(1.55e-6, x, y, eps)
        modes = solver.solve(num_modes=1)

        assert len(modes) > 0
        assert modes[0].neff.real > 1.0
        assert modes[0].neff.real < 3.5
```

### Test Categories

Use markers for different test types:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_large_simulation():
    """This test takes a while."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.gpu
def test_gpu_backend():
    """Requires GPU."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_full_workflow():
    """Tests multiple components together."""
    pass
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Format

Use NumPy style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
    """
    Short one-line summary.

    Longer description explaining what the function does,
    how it works, and any important details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : type
        Description of param1.
    param2 : type
        Description of param2.

    Returns
    -------
    return_type
        Description of return value.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When invalid input is provided.

    See Also
    --------
    related_function : Related functionality.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> result = function_name(1.0, 2.0)
    >>> print(result)
    3.0

    Notes
    -----
    Additional mathematical or implementation details.

    References
    ----------

```
feat(modes): add mode port boundary condition

Implement mode ports for waveguide S-parameter extraction.
Includes mode injection, extraction, and overlap integrals.

Closes #6

---

fix(solver): correct Courant condition for 3D

The 3D Courant limit calculation was incorrect.
Now properly accounts for all three dimensions.

---

docs(tutorials): add S-parameter extraction tutorial

New tutorial showing how to extract S-parameters using
mode expansion monitors.
```

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing PRs:

### What to Look For

- **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
- **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is it well documented?
- **Performance**: Any performance concerns?
- **Style**: Follows code style?
- **Breaking changes**: Any API changes?

### Providing Feedback

Be constructive and specific:

**Good:**

```
The mode overlap calculation looks correct, but could be optimized
by pre-computing the mode normalization. Consider moving line 45
to the __init__ method.
```

**Not as helpful:**

```
This is slow.
```
