"""
Field monitors and data collection.

This module provides tools for monitoring and extracting data
from FDTD simulations:
- Field probes and samplers
- Power flux monitors
- Mode monitors for waveguides
- Near-to-far field transforms
"""

# Monitor implementations:
# - FieldMonitor: Spatial and temporal field sampling
# - FluxMonitor: Power flux calculation through surfaces
# - ModeMonitor: Waveguide mode amplitude extraction
# - NearToFarTransform: Far-field radiation pattern calculation
# - ReflectionTransmission: S-parameter calculation
