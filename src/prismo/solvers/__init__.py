"""
FDTD solver implementations.

This module provides different FDTD solver variants:
- Standard Yee-grid FDTD
- Higher-order FDTD schemes
- Parallel and GPU-accelerated solvers

# Solver implementations will be added here:
# - YeeSolver: Standard Yee-grid FDTD solver
# - HighOrderSolver: Higher-order accurate schemes
# - CUDASolver: GPU-accelerated implementation
# - ParallelSolver: Multi-threaded CPU implementation
